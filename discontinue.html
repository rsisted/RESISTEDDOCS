      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>Hello! I am rsisted, Founder of RESISTED Softworks.</p>
      <p>RESISTED Softworks is a development group that designs: Systems (Admin Systems, Parkour Systems), Security (Anti-Cheat) and game modifications (RSBlocks)</p>
      <p>We also contribute to finding vulnerabilities and bugs in games and report them to the developers of said game.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately we got informed by the owners of the game that RSBlocks operates in that we are no longer allowed to create and use mods in their game.</p>
        <p>Ofcourse it was gonna be obvious that this would've happened because not only did we not ask for permission but it's also strictly against the rules.</p>
        <p>Now you should obviously respect their decision on this as cheating comes with a risk, and not long after our mod existed. Someone has already designed or did malicious cheating in their game.</p>
        <p>RESISTED Softworks is deleting or reusing this website in the near future for Eurobuild.</p>

        <h2>What now?</h2>
        <p>The videos will remain up and we will use the server for our other projects. As for RSBlocks, it is no longer going to be in service and the source code will be removed.</p>
        <p>Thank you for tuning in this week's RESISTED Softworks project. We had a blast and people enjoyed our modifications</p>
        <p>I thank you for using RSBlocks and I'll see you on the flip side. Goodbye!</p>
